# `platform-smoke-test` delivery contract

This contract says what an agent may deliver in this repo on its own, which evidence
proves a change is done, and when it must stop and ask. Until **Scope** names a
production target, agents may merge changes that pass the gates but must not deploy
anything; request attention instead.

## Scope

- Production target: TODO (service, environment, URL).
- Deployed by: TODO (workflow file and trigger).
- Out of scope: changes to another deployed service, data migrations, and anything
  the gates below cannot validate. Request attention instead of stretching this
  contract.

## Delivery gates

### Local checks

Run from a clean worktree before publishing or updating the pull request:

```bash
mise run ci
```

Record every command and result in the pull request. Do not replace a failed check
with an exclusion, a generated-file edit, or a weaker command.

### Branch and review policy

`main` requires a pull request and the `platform / checks` status check, blocks
deletion and non-fast-forward updates, and allows only squash merges. An agent may
merge without routine human approval once every triggered check has passed and every
actionable review finding is resolved (the `complete-pr-review-loop` skill).

Read the live rules before each merge; live policy wins if it is stricter:

```bash
gh api repos/janclem/platform-smoke-test/rulesets
```

Never use an administrator bypass, change the ruleset, dismiss a review, or mark a
check successful. Merge only with `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch`,
then read the PR again and record its `mergeCommit.oid` as `<merged-revision>`.

## Deployment and production proof

TODO once Scope names a target. State:

- which run must deploy `<merged-revision>` (workflow, event, `headSha`, conclusion);
- the production smoke test that runs after deploy, with unauthenticated read-only
  requests against the fixed production origin;
- any change-specific check, stated in the PR before merge.

Success requires: the PR is squash-merged at `<merged-revision>`; the deploy run for
exactly that revision succeeded; the smoke test and any change-specific check passed
afterwards. A superseded or cancelled run is not evidence. Record the PR URL, merged
revision, run URL, smoke results and UTC timestamps where the work is tracked (the
Work Graph once it exists; the PR until then).

## Failed rollout and rollback

Prefer a bounded repair when the cause is clear, production is still usable, and the
repair can pass the same gates promptly. Otherwise roll back: TODO (guarded rollback
workflow, if the target has one). Make the source durable by reverting the merged
squash commit in a new PR that goes through the same gates. Never force-push `main`.

## Authority and attention

An agent may edit code, push its branch, open and update a pull request, respond to
review, squash-merge after the gates pass, let the deploy workflow run, inspect public
production responses, and revert its own merged change.

It may not bypass branch protection, alter required checks or environment
protections, expose or rotate credentials, dismiss a security alert, deploy anything
outside Scope, perform destructive data work, or call a rollout healthy because an
upload finished.

Missing access, a policy conflict, an unsafe fix, an ambiguous validation result, or
one failed recovery attempt requires a blocking attention request. Name the single
decision or permission needed and keep the evidence already gathered.
