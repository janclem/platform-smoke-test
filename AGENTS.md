# Agent guide

## Project
Throwaway project that exercises the agent-platform template and policy

## Tooling
- All tools are pinned in `mise.toml`. Run `mise install` first; use tools via mise.
- The project's checks are the `ci` mise task. CI runs it after the platform checks, so
  `mise run ci` locally predicts the required `platform / checks` result.

## Rules
- Never commit secrets. Encrypted files via `sops` only; plaintext secrets are a hard stop.
- `main` is protected: work on a branch, open a PR, squash-merge. Use the
  `complete-pr-review-loop` skill to take a PR from draft to settled.
- Record architecturally significant choices with the `adr-writing` skill.
- Keep config declarative. Multi-line scripts go in checked-in script files, not inline in YAML.

## Delivery
[docs/runbooks/delivery-contract.md](docs/runbooks/delivery-contract.md) defines the gates, the
evidence that proves a change is done, and what needs the owner's say-so. Until it names a
production target, merge changes that pass the gates but deploy nothing.

## Platform-managed files
This repo was generated from `janclem/agent-platform`. The CI workflows, `.agents/skills/`,
`.claude/skills/`, and this guide come from its Copier template; change shared behavior there
and pull it in with `copier update`. Project-specific additions to this guide are fine and
survive updates.

## Done means
Checks pass, PR merged, and the change is verified where it runs. An open PR is not done.
